This project shows how to use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to deploy a CNN-based fruit classifier on Heroku. The CNN-model was implemented under the keras framework based on transfer learning from a VGG16 model trained on Imagenet. The app allows users to upload images to the server and returns a prediction of whether the image contains apples, oranges or pears with the associated probability. Files uploaed must be images in a format that is readable by PILLOW (eg. png, jpg, bmp). If an unreadable image or an image with dimension !=3 is uploaded, image read error and image dimension error will be shown respectively. The user can upload a new image using the link at the top left corner. [Click on the fruit image above to launch app]
